## Overview
I had not done any html or css in several months and I needed a referesher. This was a good way to get my head back into the step and the code. Laying out HTML isn't fairly easy, my main challenge is deciding where I need to add divs. 
Then styling with CSS just takes time, especially with the layout, using flexbox, margins, padding, floats.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

-After inital commit, my imagage did not come though, so I had to fix the file path. 
-I was assisted with flexbox centering/aligning without using margins, thank you @correlucas
-I always need more help with padding/margins, it doesn't seem to happen the fist time around for me, but it is fun and easy enought to try differnt ones until it looks correct. 
-I reveiwed Flexbox a bit more. 

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

-And I had no clue what markdown was so the above link was interesting. 

### Continued development
I don't feel completely comfortable to any of it yet :) So I just want to keep practicing, this first project took longer than I though. I thought I would do it in one day/ session, but it took a few sessions. 

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp Is my go to for help with everything coding! 
- https://skillcrush.com/ is the bootcamp I am doing most of my training though.
